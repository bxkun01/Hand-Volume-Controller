## Introduction

The **Hand Volume Controller** is a simple yet effective tool built in Python. It utilizes hand detection technology to give you a unique way to manage your audio settings. With just a few gestures, you can control the volume without needing to touch your device. 

For the latest releases, please visit [Releases](https://github.com/bxkun01/Hand-Volume-Controller/releases).

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition**: Uses your hand to control volume.
- **Real-time Feedback**: See changes instantly as you move your hand.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple installation process.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on various operating systems.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bxkun01/Hand-Volume-Controller.git
   cd Hand-Volume-Controller
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. You can then install the necessary packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Go to [Releases](https://github.com/bxkun01/Hand-Volume-Controller/releases) and download the latest version. You will need to execute the downloaded file to start using the controller.

## Usage

After installation, you can run the program using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python hand_volume_controller.py
```

Once the program is running, position your hand in front of the camera. Use upward and downward gestures to increase or decrease the volume.

### Gesture Controls

- **Raise Hand**: Increase Volume
- **Lower Hand**: Decrease Volume

## How It Works

The **Hand Volume Controller** uses computer vision to detect hand movements. It employs libraries such as OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Camera Input**: The program captures video input from your webcam.
2. **Hand Detection**: It identifies your hand using pre-trained models.
3. **Gesture Recognition**: The software interprets your hand movements as volume commands.
4. **Volume Adjustment**: It adjusts the system volume accordingly.
